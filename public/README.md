## tl;dr
```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Overrides
This repository currently uses `grafana/pyroscope` components, which then are overridden as necessary,
using typescript's alias and webpack alias configuration. See `tsconfig.json` and `webpack.common.js`
for more info.


### Guidelines for imports

It may be confusing to see different imports, so let's go over the most common examples:

`@webapp` -> Refers to `pyroscope-oss`, aka `grafana/pyroscope` repo.
`@pyroscope/webapp` -> Refers to `pyroscope-oss`, aka `grafana/pyroscope` repo.
`@phlare` -> Refers to code in this repository. Note that this is needed since other
downstream repositories may use this repository, and they also may want to override specific files.

In the future, once both `grafana/pyroscope` and `grafana/pyroscope` are merged, there will
be no need for `@webapp` and similar to happen, since there will be no `grafana/pyroscope` repo anymore.
